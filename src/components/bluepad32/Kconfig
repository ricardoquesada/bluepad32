    config BLUEPAD32_MAX_DEVICES
        int  "Maximum of connected gamepads"
        default 4
        help
        The maximum number of gamepads that can be connected at the same time.

        This limit is defined at compile-time because Bluepad32 tries not to use malloc.
        The higher the number, the more RAM it will take.

    config BLUEPAD32_GAP_SECURITY
        bool "Enable GAP Security"
        default y
        help
            When enabled, it will set GAP Security level to 2.
            This allows Nintendo Switch Pro controller to connect successfully.

            But when enabled, DualShock 3 gamepad fails to connect.

            Only disable it if you want to use DualShock 3 gamepads.

            Enables Bluetooth Low Energy by default.
            Needed for some mice and gamepads that only work with BLE.
            Can be overriden from the console by using the command "ble_enabled"

    config BLUEPAD32_UNIJOYSTICLE_ENABLE_SWAP_FOR_C64

        depends on BLUEPAD32_PLATFORM_UNIJOYSTICLE
        default y
        help
            Enables Swap button in for the Unijoysticle2 C64.
            By enabling it, if the firmware is used in the FlashParty Edition,
            then the Swap button might trigger unexpectedly.
            So, unless you are using FlashParty Edition, leave this feature enabled.

    config BLUEPAD32_MAX_ALLOWLIST
        int  "Maximum size of the Bluetooth allowlist"
        default 4
        help
        The maximum of addresses that can be inserted in the Bluetooth allowlist.

        This limit is defined at compile-time because Bluepad32 tries not to use malloc.
        The higher the number, the more RAM it will take.

    config BLUEPAD32_ENABLE_VIRTUAL_DEVICE_BY_DEFAULT
        bool "Enable Virtual Devices by default"
        default n
        help
            A Virtual Device is when a controller like DualSense or DualShock4
            supports also mouse (it is a touchpad, but converted to mouse).
            In this case the "mouse" will represent a virtual device.
            When this happends, Bluepad32 reports that two devices are connected:
            a gamepad and a mouse.
            The "gamepad device" has the "mouse virtual device" as child device.
            When the controller disconnects, or when the "gamepad device"
            is forced to disconnect then both devices will be disconnected.
            Can be overriden from the console by using the command "virtual_device_enabled"
