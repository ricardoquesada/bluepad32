### New
- Pico W: Implement property using BTstack TLV
- Linux: Implement property using BTstack TLV
- BLE Service: Add "reset" characteristic
- Arch: Added `uni_system_reboot()` function

### Fixed
- Doc: Many fixes to documentation, including adding/changing/removing pages to MKDocs.

### Changed
- Platform boot logic changed a bit. Rationale: "don't make magic changes".
  - `uni_main()` does not call `btstack_run_loop_execute()` automatically. Must be called by the user
  - `uni_main()` renamed to `uni_init()`.
    - Rationale:  `uni_init()` just does the initialization. Before `uni_main` was doing init and main loop.
  - BT scan is OFF by default. Platform must call `uni_bt_enable_new_connections` to enable it.
  - `platform->get_properties()` does nothing. To list/delete Bluetooth keys platform must call them explicitly.
  - Custom platform:
    - must call `uni_platform_set_custom(...)` before calling `uni_init()`
    - `uni_platform_custom_create()` removed
  - ESP32 main:
    - `uni_esp32_main()` removed.
    - Users must call the different "init" steps manually. Added helper `uni_esp32_init()`
    - Rationale: Pico W and ESP32 `main()` is almost the same. Easier to setup/customize/understand.
  - All examples updated
- New "unsafe" functions, useful to be called from `platforom->on_init_complete()`
  - `uni_bt_enable_new_connections_unsafe()`
  - `uni_bt_del_keys_unsafe()`
  - `uni_bt_list_keys_unsafe()`
- "PC_DEBUG" platform:
  - Removed the "PLATFORM_PC_DEBUG" option.
  - Instead, "pc_debug" still exists, but internally uses "custom" platform.
- Allowlist: rename `uni_bt_allowlist_allow_addr()` to `uni_bt_allowlist_is_allowed_addr()`
- Folder organization:
  - arch/: includes console, uart, property files (one for each: ESP32, Pico, Linux)
  - bt/: includes all the Bluetooth related files
  - platform/: includes all the platform files
  - parser:/ includes all the parser files
  - controller/: controller files
  - Added <uni.h> file, easier for 3rd party user. Just include that file, and
     don't worry about internal folder re-organization.
- Arduino platform:
  - Removed from "bluepad32" repo. Moved to the [Bluepad32 Arduino template][bluepad32-arduino-template] project.
- Virtual Device: Disabled by default. To enable it call: `void uni_virtual_device_set_enabled(true);`
- BTstack: Using latest develop branch. Hash: 4b3f8617054370b0e96650ee65edea1c23591ed4
- Docs: Documentation hosted in readthedocs: <https://bluepad32.readthedocs.io/>
- Docs: New Bluepad32 logo <https://github.com/ricardoquesada/bluepad32/blob/main/docs/images/bluepad32-logo.png>
- Docs: Using Github as the default repo, not Gitlab

## [3.10.3] - 2023-11-26
### New
- Atari Wireless Joystick: Add support for it

### Changed
- Allowlist: rename `uni_bt_allowlist_allow_addr()` to `uni_bt_allowlist_is_allowed_addr()`

## [3.10.2] - 2023-11-13
### Changed
- BTstack: Upgraded to latest develop branch as of 2023-11-13

### Fixed
- Xbox: Axis works Ok (fixed in latest BTstack)

## [3.10.1] - 2023-11-05
### New
- Arduino: API to handle keyboard
  - `Controller.isKeyboard()`
  - `Controller.isKeypressed(KeyboardKey)`
  - Sketch.cpp updated with Keyboard, Mouse, Gamepad, BalanceBoard code

### Changed
- Kconfig: Log Level "choice" and "int" as log level verbosity
  - Easier to handle in code. Doesn't "pollute" the Kconfig options

### Fixed
- Arduino: Correctly report Keyboard/Mouse types [Github Issue #48][github_issue_48]
- Keyboard: Typos in Keyboard constants

[github_issue_48]: https://github.com/ricardoquesada/bluepad32/issues/48

## [3.10.0] - 2023-11-02
### New
- Keyboard support (BETA, might change in the future):
  - Bluetooth keyboard is supported: Up to 10 keys pressed at the same time + modifiers
  - Unijoysticle:
    - Keyboard behaves like a joystick using arrow keys or ASDW
    - Press "Escape" to change Joystick ports
    - Press "Tab" to change Modes

### Changed
- Custom platform:
  - "uni_platform_custom_1" renamed to "my_platform"
  - Removed main/Kconfig. Keeping the configuration simpler.
- Arduino:
  - Virtual Devices disabled by default
  - Added `BP32.enableVirtualDevice(bool)` API in BP32 namespace
  - Sketch shows how to use it

### Fixed
- Tank Mouse (Bluetooth version) works Ok. Good for Amiga users using Unijoysticle.

## [v3.9.1] - 2023-10-13
### New
- "custom platform":
  - It is a new platform useful to start using Bluepad32 withou any dependency like Arduino.
  - Ideal if you are familiar with ESP-IDF and want full control

### Fixed
- Better DualShock3 support
- Better DualShock4 support
- Unijoysticle: Twin Stick mode works with virtual devices

## [v3.9.0] - 2023-09-16
### New
- Add touchpad support for DualSense and DualShock4 controllers.
  When one of these devices connect, it creates a mouse virtual device that is controlled
  by the "gamepad" controller. So, two connections will appear.
  - Can be enabled/disable from console using `virtual_device_enable`
  - Default value is enabled. Can be modified from `idf.py menuconfig`
  - Fixes issue: [Gitlab Issue #33][gitlab_issue_33]
- Unijoysticle A500: Virtual Device support to control Amiga mouse from DualSense and DualShock4.
  It is possible to "swap" the mouse and joystick port, and a connection from a new controller disconnects
  the virtual device (the mouse).
  - Fixes issue: [Gitlab Issue #22][gitlab_issue_22]
- New controller button supported:
  - `MISC_BUTTONS_CAPTURE`. From Arduino call `ctl->miscCapture()`
  - This is the "share" button in the Xbox 1914 model (the "3rd" button).
  - This is the "mute" button in the DualSense controller.
  - This is the "capture" button on Switch Pro controller.
  - Fixes issue: [Gitlab Issue #37][gitlab_issue_37]

### Changed
- Merge set/get console commands into one, making it a less polluted console.
  If no arguments are passed, it behaves like a getter.
  - `set_autofire_cps` / `get_autofire_cps` -> `autofire_cps`
  - `set_gamepad_mode` / `get_gamepad_mode` -> `gamepad_mode`
  - `set_bb_move_threshold` / `get_bb_move_threshold` -> `bb_move_threshold`
  - `set_bb_fire_threshold` / `get_bb_fire_threshold` -> `bb_fire_threshold`
  - `set_c64_pot_mode` / `get_c64_pot_mode` -> `c64_pot_mode`
  - `set_mouse_scale` / `get_mouse_scale` -> `mouse_scale`
  - `set_gap_security_level` / `get_gap_security_level` -> `gap_security_level`
  - `set_gap_periodic_inquiry` / `get_gap_peridic_inquiry` -> `gap_periodic_inquiry`
  - `set_ble_enabled` / `get_ble_enabled` -> `ble_enable`
  - `set_incoming_connections_enabled` / `incoming_connections_enable`
- Constants in uni_gamepad.h:
  - `MISC_BUTTONS_BACK` -> `MISC_BUTTONS_SELECT` (`ctl->miscSelect()`)
  - `MISC_BUTTONS_HOME` -> `MISC_BUTTONS_START` (`ctl->miscStart()`)
  - The old constants / functions are still present, but are deprecated.
  - The rationale is that these names should be easier to remember.

### Fixed
- Switch: Fix crash while parsing IMU data ([Bug GH44][github_issue_44])
- Xbox: Maps R1/R2 to Brake/Gas ([Bug GL34][gitlab_issue_34])
- Xbox: on FW 5.x, "select" button is mapped ([Bug GHBA07][github_ba_issue_7])
- Xbox / Stadia / Steam (other BLE devices): Connection is more reliable.
  - Fixes issue: [Gitlab Issue #35][gitlab_issue_35]

## [v3.8.3] - 2023-08-09
### Fixed
- Allowlist: Don't show "error" message when there is no error.

## [v3.8.2] - 2023-08-02
### Changed
- Unijoysticle: 800XL uses port one as default for joystick and port 2 as default for mouse.
  Each "variant" can easily specify the default ports.

### Fixed
- Allowlist: Can be called from C++ (Arduino).

## [v3.8.1] - 2023-07-30
### New
- Bluetooth Allowlist addresses:
  This feature, when enabled, will allow or decline controller connections based on their address.
  This is useful when using multiple devices running Bluepad32, and you want that certain controller
  connects to only a particular device.
  Useful for "parties", or at teaching classes.
  The following console commands were added to control the allowlist:
  - `allowlist_list`: List addresses in the allow list.
  - `allowlist_add <address>`: Add address to allow list.
  - `allowlist_remove <address>`: Remove address from allow list.
  - `allowlist_enable <0 | 1>`: Enable / Disable the allow list feature

### Changed
- BTstack: Upgraded to 1.5.6.3 (master branch as of July 29)

### Fix
- Unijoysticle: Misc and back buttons have debouncer per device.
  When multiple controllers are connected, debounce works as expected.
  Before, a `static` variable was used, and was reused by all connected
  controllers.
- Unijoysticle: Improved debug messages when trying to swap ports.

## [v3.8.0] - 2023-07-25
### New
- Unijoysticle: Add support for Unijoysticle 2 800XL board.
  Features:
   - Mouse: default AtariST.
   - 2nd and 3rd buttons work. Using [Joy 2B+ protocol][joy2bplus]
   - Twin Stick
   - and the rest of the Unijoysticle features.

[joy2bplus]: https://github.com/ascrnet/Joy2Bplus

### Changed
- Unijoysticle: "Enhanced mode" renamed to "Twin Stick" mode.
  Seems to be the name that has been used for games like Robotron 2084.
- Unijoysticle: Refactor. Each board has its own file, and its own "class".
  Easier to extend / maintain.

### Fixed
- Wii + Accel mode: Buttons "A" and "Trigger" act as fire.
  Before "fire" was not mapped, and it was not possible to play games like Lemans.
- Unijoysticle: Twin Stick works with 2nd buttons

## [v3.7.3] - 2023-06-17
### New
- Nintendo Switch: Gyro/Accel is parsed
- Unijoysticle: Support Nintendo Balance Board.
  Left,Right,Up,Down: just "press" in the right place in the Balance Board.
  Fire: Both Left and Right must be "pressed".
  Threshold (weight) is configurable via the console using:
    - `set_bb_move_threshold`
    - `get_bb_move_threshold`
    - `set_bb_fire_threshold`
    - `get_bb_fire_threshold`
- [![Video for reference](https://img.youtube.com/vi/Nj5fZlt_834/0.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nj5fZlt_834)
- Unijoysticle: Possible to swap ports in enhanced mode.
  Either press the gamepad or board "swap" button.
  The blue LED will blink once after the swap.
  The console command `list_devices` will display `mode=enhanced swapped` when it is swapped.
  Otherwise, it just shows `mode=enhanced`.

### Fixed
- Nintendo Switch: reports battery correctly.
- Nintendo Wii Balance Board: reports battery correctly.
- 8BitDo Zero 2:
  - "macOS" mode works. It identifies itself as a DualShock4, but it doesn't support
    report id 0x11, just report 0x01. Added parser for report id 0x01 is DS4 logic.
  - "keyboard" mode works. This is the only 8BitDo Zero 2 that reports "dpad" as "dpad".
    The rest of modes report the dpad as axis x & y.

## [v3.7.2] - 2023-05-20
### New
- Unijoysticle: very experimental paddle support.
  Only for developers. Not ready for public.
- Arduino: Add "disconnect" API.
  This API was already present on the NINA platform, but not in Arduino.
  They are in sync now ([Bug GH36][github_issue_36])

### Changed
- Wii Mote accelerometer exposed to Arduino/Nina/AirLift ([Bug GL28][gitlab_issue_28]).
  Before it was converted inside the Wii parser, preventing platforms to use the accelerometer
  data as they wish.
  Now the accelerometer data is exposed, and platform can do what they pleased.
  Unijoysticle platform parses it a converts it to joystick (previous behavior).


### Fixed
- GameSir T3s gamepad, when in iOS mode works.
  GameSir iOS mode is basically impersonating an Xbox Wireless with FW 4.8.
  Although the recommended for GameSir T3s, is to use it in Switch mode.

[gitlab_issue_28]: https://gitlab.com/ricardoquesada/bluepad32/-/issues/28
[github_issue_36]: https://github.com/ricardoquesada/bluepad32/issues/36

## [v3.7.1] - 2023-04-30
### New
- DualSense / DualShock 4: Report Accelerometer and Gyro data
- Steam Controller: Add support for Steam Controller.
  - Disables "lizard" mode
  - Dpad, buttons, triggers, thumbstick, right pad supported.
  - Gyro/Accel: not supported ATM

### Fixed
- Xbox Adaptive Controller: Works as expected. Removed "unsupported usage" messages.
- Arduino / NINA / CircuitPython: Add APIs to read gyro / accel.

## [v3.7.0] - 2023-04-17
### New
- Arduino/NINA/AirLift: Added BP32.localBdAddress()([Bug GL5][bluepad32_arduino_issue5]).
  Returns the Local BD Address (AKA Mac Address).
  Updated example that shows how to use it.

[bluepad32_arduino_issue5]: https://gitlab.com/ricardoquesada/bluepad32-arduino/-/issues/5

### Fixed
- Arduino documentation: How to use Arduino IDE and other minor fixes

## [v3.7.0-rc.0] - 2023-04-15
### New
- Support ESP32-S3 / ESP32-C3
  Only BLE gamepads are supported, since BR/EDR is not supported on ESP32-S3 / ESP32-C3.
  Notice that ESP32-S3 has two cores, like ESP32. Bluetooth stack runs on one core,
  and Arduino Sketch runs on the other core.
  But ESP32-C3 only has one core. Meaning that both Bluetooth and Arduino Sketch share the same
  core. It works perfectly well for basic applications. But ESP32 or ESP32-S3 is a better option
  for advanced application.s
- Initial Support for Arduino IDE + ESP32.
  See [plat_arduino.md] for details.
  This means that you can use ESP32 / ESP32-S3 / ESP32-C3 with Bluepad32 from  Arduino IDE.

[plat_arduino.md]: https://gitlab.com/ricardoquesada/bluepad32/-/blob/main/docs/plat_arduino.md

### Changed
- `uni_bluetooth_` functions renamed to `uni_bt_`
- `uni_bluetooth.[ch]` files renamed to `uni_bt.[ch]`
- `uni_bt_setup_get/set_properties` functions renamed to `uni_bt_get/set_properties`
- Moved all the BR/EDR logic from `uni_bluetooth.c` to `uni_bt_bredr`
- BR/EDR code is only compiled in ESP32, and not in ESP32-S3/C3 since it is not supported.
- `Makefile` files removed. It has been deprecated for a while.
  To compile Bluepad32 use `idf.py build` instead.

## [v3.6.2] - 2023-04-02
### New
- Add support for Sony Motion Controller
- Unijoysticle: Gamepad button "Start" triggers "gamepad change mode".
  It is useful to switch back and forth from "gamepad" to "mouse" mode without the need
  to press the "black button" on the Unijoysticle.
  - On V2+ / A500 it cycles between: `normal` -> `mouse` -> `enhanced` modes
  - On V2 / C64 it cycles between: `normal` -> `enhanced` modes.
- tools/sixaxixpairer: Supports PS3 Nav controllers

### Changed
- Arduino: `app_main` is part of Bluepad32
  This makes it easier to port Bluepad32 to Arduino IDE.
  Arduino user: need to update the example code, otherwise two `app_main` functions
  will get compiled and the linker wil complain about it.

## [v3.6.1] - 2023-03-04
### New
- C64: Add support for 5button mode, in addition to 3button and rumble.
  - Info about 5 button mode here: https://github.com/crystalct/5plusbuttonsJoystick

### Changed
- BLE is enabled by default
- Unijoysticle C64: C64GS buttons work.
  - Supports the official C64GS 2nd button
  - Supports the unofficial 3rd button

## [v3.6.0] - 2023-02-04
### New
- Arduino: Added ScrollWheel support in Mouse

### Changed
- Added option in "menuconfig" to enable Swap Button in Unijoysticle C64/FlashParty Edition
  - Enabled by default. Before the Swap Button was disabled.

### Fixed
  - Updated documentation regarding ESP-IDF version
  - Updated documentation regarding Controllers and BR/EDR and BLE

## [v3.6.0-rc1] - 2023-01-29
### New
- BLE support (experimental). Enable it from "idf.py menuconfig" or
  from console with `set_ble_enabled`. It is disabled by default
  Tested with:
  - Xbox Wireless Controller model 1914 with Firmware 5.15
  - Xbox Wireless Controller model 1708 with Firmware 5.15
  - Stadia Controller with BLE Firmware
  - Microsoft BLE mouse
  - Generic BLE mouse
 - Mouse: Add "scroll_wheel" property. Updated when the mouse scroll wheel is moved.

### Changed
- Refactored a bit the Bluetooth code to better support BLE
- Console command: "set_bluetooth_enabled" renamed to "set_incoming_connections_enabled"

### Fixed
- "disconnect" console command also deletes the connected device

## [v3.6.0-rc0] - 2023-01-16
### New
- Platforms: Receive "controller" instead of "gamepad". A controller can be a:
  gamepad, mouse, keyboard, balance board. And possible more. Battery is reported
  in the new Controller API.
- Arduino & NINA: Updated to support the new "controller" inteface. The old interface
  is still working, but the client calls the new one.

### Changed
- ESP-IDF: Added support for v5.0 but:
  - Arduino still requires v4.4 until esp32-core supports v5.0
  - NINA requires Legacy Flash SPI that was removed in v5.0
  - Unijoysticle, AirLift and MightyMiggy are the ones that can use v5.0 ATM
- BTstack: Updated to v1.5.5
- 8BitDo: Updated support for SN30 Pro FW v2 and M30

### Fixed
- Unijoysticle: "cycle" button works correctly when mouse and gamepad are
  connected at the same time.
- Switch, DualShock4, DualSense, Wii Balance Board: report battery status ([Github Issue #25][github_issue_25])

[github_issue_25]: https://github.com/ricardoquesada/bluepad32/issues/25

## [v3.5.2] - 2022-12-04
### New
- Arduino: Add "version" console command
- NINA/AirLift: Add command to disconnect gamepad ([Github Issue #26][github_issue_26])
- Console: Add "disconnect" command
- Console: Add "gpio_get", "gpio_set" commands. Useful for testing

### Changed
- BTstack: Updated to v1.5.4
- ESP-IDF: Tested with release/v4.4 hash (9269a536ac123677b165ff531369dfd1338ef103)

### Fixed
- Bluetooth state machine: Don't update name if connection is already established ([Issue #21][gitlab_bug_21])
- Doc: Update instructions about flashing Bluepad32 on UNI WiFi Rev.2
       Improved instructions regarding how to program the ESP32

[github_issue_26]: https://github.com/ricardoquesada/bluepad32/issues/26
[gitlab_bug_21]: https://gitlab.com/ricardoquesada/bluepad32/-/issues/21

## [v3.5.1] - 2022-09-06
### Changed
- ESP-IDF: Using v4.4.2 hash 6d7877fcb8dda2ad971880b4e7ceda5b53c54019

### Fixed
- Unijoysticle can swap ports with "Select" button, in addition to the already suported "Home" button ([Github Issue #20][github_issue_20])
- Xbox: Don't enable left/right actuators for rumble.
  Trigger-right and Trigger-left actuatores are still enabled.
  This is to prevent the rumble-forever in 8BitDo controllers ([Gitlab Issue #10][gitlab_uni_issue_10])

[gitlab_uni_issue_10]: https://gitlab.com/ricardoquesada/unijoysticle2/-/issues/10

## [v3.5.0] - 2022-07-09
### New
- Console commands: New `list_bluetooth_keys` and `del_bluetooth_keys`

### Changed
- Console commands: Rename `devices` to `list_devices`

### Fixed
- Bluetooth LED works as expected in Unijoysticle

## [v3.5.0-rc0] - 2022-07-04
### New
- Mouse: Added support for:
  - LogiLink ID0078A
- Unijoysticle console commands:
  - Be able to change the autofire "click-per-second" with:
    `set_autofire_cps` and `get_autofire_cps`.
  - Be able to enable/disable incoming Bluetooth connections with:
    `set_bluetooth_enabled`
- Wii: Add support for Wii Balance Board

### Changed
- Console:
  - `set_mouse_scale(value)` where a higher value means faster movement.
     Before it meant "higher value == slower movement"
  - `version` shows Unijoysticle, Bluepad32 and Chip info
- Unijoysticle2 A500:
  Bluetooth LED is also used as status:
  Blink 1, 2 or 3 times means gamepad mode: "normal", "mouse" or "enhanced"
  "Mode button" cycles between those 3 modes, and the BT LED is used as feedback.
  "Swap button", when succeed, it blinks once. It fails it you try to swap when
  a gamepad is in enhanced mode.
- Unijoysticle2 auto-enable-bluetooth:
  If Bluetooth is disabled via the console, then the "auto" feature is disabled.
  The only way to enable bluetooth again is via the console, or with a reset.
- Unijoysticle: `auto` mouse emulation deleted. Use `amiga` or `atarist` instead.
- Platform: renamed `on_device_oob_event` to `on_oob_event`.
  Bluetooth enabled/disabled OOB event is sent ot the platforms.
- DualShock3: Can connect even on GAP Security Level 2.
  No need to change the GAP level.
- `uni_bluetooth_enable_new_connections()`, when disabled, paired devices can connect [Github Issue #21][github_issue_21]

[github_issue_21]: https://github.com/ricardoquesada/bluepad32/issues/21

## [3.5.0-beta1] - 2022-06-17
## New
- Arduino: Add "Console" class. An alternative to Arduino "Serial" that is
  compatible with Bluepad32's USB console.
- Property storage abstraction
  API that allows to store key/values in non-volatile areas
- Console. Added new commands:
  `get` / `set_gap_security_level`: Similar to the `menuconfig` option, but no need to recompile it.
  `get` / `set_gap_periodic_inquiry`: To change the new-connection/reconnection window
- NINA/AirLift: Add support for "enable/disable new bluetooth connections"
  - Add "type of controller" in GamepadProperty flags: gamepad, mouse or keyboard
- Mouse: Added support for:
  - Apple Magic Mouse 2nd gen

## [3.5.0-beta0] - 2022-05-30
### New
- Mouse support:
  Bluetooth BR/EDR mice supported. Only a few are supported at the moment.
  This is to fine-tune the DPI. Mouse data is populated in the gamepad structure:
  - axis_x / axis_y contains the mouse delta movements normalized from -127/127.
  - Left button: A
  - Right button: B
  - Middle button: X
- Mouse: Added "quadrature encoder" driver. Supports up to two
   mice at the same time. Each mouse requires 2 timers. So if two mice are used
   at the same time, that means that there are no HW timers left.
- Unijoysticle: Supports Amiga/AtariST mouse. Two mice can be used at the same time.
  - Unijoysticle v2+ / v2 A500: fully functional mouse on both ports
  - Unijoysticle v2: fully functional mouse on Port #1. Right/Middle button not available on Port #2
- Unijoysticle: Amiga/AtariST mouse emulation can be changed from `menuconfig` or console. See below.
- Unijoysticle: Support for Unijoysticle v2 A500 (a new board that fits in the Amiga 500/1200)
- Unijoysticle: New supported combinations to swap ports by pressing "system" gamepad button:
  - Gamepad and Mouse
  - Gamepad and Gamepad while both press "system" at the same time
- Doc: List of supported mice is here: [supported mice][supported_mice]
- console: Added a "USB console". Access it from `idf.py monitor` or `minicom`
  It has the following commands:
  - `set_mouse_emulation` / `get_mouse_emulation`
  - `set_mouse_scale` / `get_mouse_scale`
  - `set_gamepad_mode` / `get_gamepad_mode`
  - `swap_ports`
  - `devices`
  - `tasks`, `version`, `help` and more

## [3.1.1] - 2022-04-22
### Fixed
- NINA/AirLift: Binaries are generated with UART console disabled. [Bug bp32-arduino #3][gitlab_bp32_arduino_03]
   UART console can be enabled/disabled from menuconfig and only when NINA/AirLift are not selected.
- Cleanup connect/disconnect code
- pc_debug: Enable extra compiler-warnings to check possible bugs

[gitlab_bp32_arduino_03]: https://gitlab.com/ricardoquesada/bluepad32-arduino/-/issues/3

## [3.1.0] - 2022-04-14
### New
- Wii: Add support for Rumble
- Arduino,AirLift,NINA: Add support for "get gamepad properties" and
  "enable Bluetooth connections"
- Gamepad: Add support for Nintendo SNES (Swicth Online)

### Changed
- 8BitDo: "Dinput" mode mappings updated to match the other modes' mappings:
  Button "-" / "select" maps to BUTTON_BACK
  Button "+" / "start" maps to BUTTON_HOME
  BUTTON_SYSTEM is not mapped any more.
- Nintendo Joycons mappings updated for the "-", "+", "home" and "capture".
  The button that is at the left, is mapped to BUTTON_BACK
  The button that is at the right, is mapped to BUTTON_HOME
- Arduino: Example code supports multiple gamepad connections
  Internally ArduinoGamepad.h was refactored to better support "gamepad properties".
- Wii: When in accelerometer mode (wheel):
  - Dpad can be used, useful for menu navigation
  - Button "1" is brake (Dpad down)
  - Button "2" is Throttle (Dpad up)
  - "Up" and "Down" disabled from Accelerometer
- Unijoysticle: Disable Bluetooth connections once two gamepads are connected,
  or when in "Enhanced Mode". Re-enable when that's not the case.

### Fixed
- Arduino/NINA/AirLift: Assign gamepad type at connection time: [Bug #10][gitlab_bug_10]
- Compile-time error if ACL connections are not least 2 [Bug #11][gitlab_bug_11]
- "Enable/Disable Bluetooth connections" works everytime it is called.

## [3.0.1] - 2022-03-15
### New
- Arduino: Add function to return Gamepad model

### Changed
- Update BTStack to latest stable. Hash: 45e937e1ce34444aabbc21ec35504e1c50ad528d
- Compiler option: Using -O2 (optimize for performance) by default. Debug disabled.

### Fixed
- 8BitDo: Added SF30 Pro to the DB. It correctly identifies it as 8BitDo gamepad.

## [3.0.0] - 2022-02-27
### New
- Docs: Added CONTRIBUTING.md file

### Changed
- Update ESP-IDF v4.4 to hash: 000d3823bb2ff697c327958e41e9dfc6b772822a

### Fixed
- Docs: Minor fixes in documentation, moved images to its own folder.
- 8BitDo: Added SFC30 to the DB. It correctly identifies it as 8BitDo gamepad.

## [3.0.0-rc1] - 2022-02-06
### Changed
- Bluetooth: To err on the safe side, new connection have a bigger window time to connect,
  and re-connects (incoming connections) a slightly smaller window. I'll revisit this in the future.
- Wii: Accelerometer mode works as if the Wii Remote is being inside a Wii Wheel.
  This is because the "old" mode was not rather difficult to use, and using it for the
  Wii Whell is very usable in C64 racing games.

### Fixed
- Bluetooth: use page scan / clock offset if available when requesting name.
  This used to be the case in v2.5, but disabled during the big refactoring.
- Unijoysticle: correclty set Player LED when second player connects
- Unijoysticle: reject new connections if two gamepads are already connected.
- Unijoysticle: On DualSense gamepads, update Player LEDs when gamepad connects.
- Nintendo Switch: Pressing "system" button has a delay of 200ms before being able
  to press it again. This helps switching the Joystick port in Unijoysticle.
- Nintendo Switch: While setting up the controller, each step has its own timeout.
  This helps setup clones that might need certain steps in order to enable report 0x30.
- 8BitDo: Added SNES30 to the DB. It correctly identifies it as 8BitDo gamepad.
- MightyMiggy: All internal functions declared static to avoid collision with other projects.

## [3.0.0-rc0] - 2022-01-31
### New
- Devices: Support for feature reports.
- DualSense / DualShock 4: add support for get firmware version and calibration values.
  Although calibration is ignored ATM.
- Switch JoyCon clones: Added support for clones (at least some of them).
- DualShock3: Add partial support for DualShock 3 clones, like PANHAI.
- 8BitDo Arcade Stick: Add support for it.
  It keeps responding to inquiries even after the device is connected.
- API to change mappings. Although this feature is not complete yet.
  Missing save/restore, BLE service. Consider it WIP.

### Changed
- DualSense: Player LEDs are reported in the same way as PlayStation 5.
- Switch: Don't turn ON Home Light,  8BitDo devices don't support it,
  and might break the gamepad setup sequence.
  Change order of setup commands.
  Change mappings in JoyCons so that it is possible to press "System" button.
- Xbox: Highly improved reliability (based on the new auto delete code)
  Compared to before, it is like 10x more reliable, but the Xbox Wireless Controller
  is still somewhat unreliable.
- API: renamed some functions / typedefs
  - uni_hid_parser() -> uni_hid_parse_input_report()
  - report_parse_raw_fn_t -> report_parse_input_report_fn_t
- These functions are "safe". Can be called from another task and/or CPU.
  The suffix "_safe" were added to their names:
  - uni_bluetooth_del_keys()
  - uni_bluetooth_enable_new_connections()
- Arduino: Seat assignment simplified.
- Bluetooth: request device name for incoming connections.
- Bluetooth: Replaced the old "auto_delete" code, which used "counts", with
  one based on a timer. New code includes incoming connections.
- Bluetooth: SDP query + state machine refactor.
  SDP query timeout using BTstack timers instead of ad-hoc one.
  SDP query moved to its ow file.
  Perform VID/PID query before HID-descriptor.
  If HID-descriptor is not needed, don't do the query. Reduces connection latency.
  DualShock 3 and Nintendo Pro Controllers are guessed by their names
  The state machine was rewritten. Although it is still complex, it is much
  easier to understand. In the process, many bugs were fixed.
  Gamepad name is requested to all gamepads. If it fails, a fake one is assigned.
  This is because the "name" is now used to identify certain devices.
  Switch Pro Controller clone improved.
  Re-connection works in many devices, including Switch clones!
  (but not all devices support reconnection yet).
  Overall, cleaner code.
- Bluetooth: Add set_event_filter.
  When doing the inquiry, only devices with a Class Of Device HID are shown.
  This reduces the noise in the console
- Tested with latest ESP-IDF v4.4 (eb3797dc3ffebd9eaf873a01df63aed89fad58b6)

### Fixed
- Bluetooth: add log about Feature Report not being supported ATM.
- Bluetooth: Incoming connections are more reliable. Using HCI periodic inquiry mode.
- Bluetooth: fix when parsing device name. Does not reuse previous discovered device.
- DualSense: doesn't not disconnect randomly
- Switch: Don't enable "home light" at setup time.
  8BitDo gamepads don't implement it and might not be able to finish setup.
  Fixed mappings of button "+" in report 0x30.

  Supported via ESP-IDF toolchain.
  A "bluepad32_arduino" ESP-IDF component was added with helper classes.
- Bluepad32 is a ESP-IDF "component":
  It makes easier to embed Bluepad32 in other projects.
- BLE: WIP. For the moment it is disabled.

- uni_conn: Placed connection variables in uni_conn instead of having them in uni_device.
  uni_device has a uni_conn_t now.
- clang-format: switched to 4-space indent, 120-column-width

### Fixed
- crc32_le() fixed. ESP32 does not call our code. Fixes core dumps and other related crc32 features.
- Unijoysticle: Turn off LEDs when gamepad disconnects.
- core: When a gamepad disconnects, it resets it state, allowing re-connecting it again (issue #1)
